# SportLens AI Docs

This folder is for architecture notes, diagrams, and implementation details.

Suggested structure:
- `architecture/` for high-level diagrams (system, deployment, data flow).
- `research/` for links to CV/ML papers and experiments.
- `api/` for REST/contract docs.

Add diagrams as PNG/SVG or use tools like Excalidraw or Mermaid inside Markdown.
